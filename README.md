## Introduction

This API interface complies to [ARC74](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0074.md) to enable efficient querying of [ARC72](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0072.md) NFT assets on AVM networks (TESTNET for now).
Adhering to [ARC74], [ARC73] and [ARC72] this ARC NFT Indexer implements a 3 layer architecture:
- Presenter API (this repo)
- [Indexing API](https://github.com/emg110/AVM-ARC-NFT-Indexer)
- [Scanner API](https://github.com/emg110/AVM-ARC-NFT-Scanner)

  ```
  Each entity in this chart plays a specific role in the system, forming a structured flow of operations from data retrieval to user interaction and delivery.

- Algod API: The starting point of the data flow, providing round based blocks and events data.
- Scanner NodeJS Module: Processes data from Algod API, scanning for ARC72 contracts.
- Indexing Serverless API: Receives and indexes data from the Scanner.
- Presenter API: Retrieves indexed data and prepares it for user interaction.
- User: The end-user who interacts with the system through the Presenter API ([ARC74]).

## Tech stack

- Vercel: Infrastructure used for NextJs based presenter API application (OA3 based)
- Cloudflare: Infrastructure used for Indexing API
- Cloudflare D1: SQL storage (SQLite API) 
- Cloudflare KV: KeyValue storage for internal parameters!
- NodeJS: Platform for Scanner module
- PM2: Reliable running agent for NodeJS. Used to reliably running Scanner module!

Note : Algorand or VOI node REST API needs to be available too! No AVM indexer API is needed!

  ```
## Architecture Note
The reason for using two separated APIs is for separation of concerns in order to achieve better results in 48 hours time window of Hackathon!

The presenter API sits in FrontEnd role and deals with rate limiting, front gate security and stuff like that while leaves the options for backend API and how it communicates data to frontend, open!

## Documentation
API is documented and tested using Swagger/OpenAPI UI: https://voi-nft-indexer-api.vercel.app
